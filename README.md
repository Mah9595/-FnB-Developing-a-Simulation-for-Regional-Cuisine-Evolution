# FnB Developing a Simulation for Regional Cuisine Evolution
Tea fermentation is an art that requires extensive human effort. This is time consuming and costly. With advances in imaging technology, we can now take pictures of tea at different stages of fermentation instead. 

In this project, we will be reproducing the results of a scientific publication that used deep learning to classify whether tea is under-, over-, or fermented just right. We will also perform feature extraction from image data for some good old machine learning modeling.
